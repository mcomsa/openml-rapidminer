      <name>Download Openml Task</name>
      <synopsis>Downloads an OpenML task. Typically passes on a dataset, target feature and splits. </synopsis>
      <help>In order to make experiments reproducible, OpenML works with the 
            concept of tasks. A task describes the dataset, target attribute, 
            estimation procedure (e.g., cross-validation, holdout set) and data
            splits (dividing observations in training and test sets). This 
            operator downloads such task from OpenML and passes it on to the
            output port. Requires an OpenML account.

      <name>Execute Openml Task</name>
      <synopsis>Executes an OpenML task. Typically returns a set of prediction. </synopsis>
      <help>This operator contains a subroutine that solves the task that is delivered 
            at the input port. 
            The subroutine is executed for each defined training set, and 
            produces a model which is then used to predict the labels for the 
            observations in the associated test set.

      <name>Upload Openml Task</name>
      <synopsis>Uploads the result of a task to OpenML.</synopsis>
      <help>This operator uploads all relevant details of the performed task, 
            including details about the workflow (operators, parameters) and the
            output (predictions, confidences). This enables research on which
            operators occur frequently in successful workflows, as well as
            identification of instances that are hard to predict. 
            Requires an OpenML account.
